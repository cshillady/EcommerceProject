Good Morning,

My name is Connor Shillady.  I am a Penn State University alumnus reaching out on behalf of the Penn State Berks Graduates Of the Last Decade (G.O.L.D.) Committee.  The goal of this committee is to bring together recent graduates for the purposes of networking with other fellow recent graduates.

Each year, around the time of Penn State's Fall Homecoming, Penn State Berks G.O.L.D. Committee holds a reunion to bring together recent graduates that are still in the area.  At this event, we try to give back to the attendees with various door prizes from local businesses.  We are reaching out to see if you would be willing to donate a gift card, or another contribution, that we could use as a door prize, and in turn would bring business back to you.  The Penn State G.O.L.D. Committee greatly appreciates any help with this event.

Thank you for your time and consideration.  Feel free to reach out by email reply with any questions, requests, or comments.

Sincerely,

Connor Shillady
Committee Co-Chair
Penn State Berks G.O.L.D. Committee
